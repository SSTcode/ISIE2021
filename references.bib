pages={5107-5119}, 
abstract={Rectifiers and voltage regulators acting as constant power loads form an important part of a microgrid's total load. In simplified form, they present a negative incremental resistance and beyond that, they have control loop dynamics in a similar frequency range to the inverters that may supply a microgrid. Either of these features may lead to a degradation of small-signal damping. It is known that droop control constants need to be chosen with regard to damping, even with simple impedance loads. Actively controlled rectifiers have been modeled in nonlinear state-space form, linearized around an operating point, and joined to network and inverter models. Participation analysis of the eigenvalues of the combined system identified that the low-frequency modes are associated with the voltage controller of the active rectifier and the droop controllers of the inverters. The analysis also reveals that when the active load dc voltage controller is designed with large gains, the voltage controller of the inverter becomes unstable. This dependence has been verified by observing the response of an experimental microgrid to step changes in power demand. Achieving a well-damped response with a conservative stability margin does not compromise normal active rectifier design, but notice should be taken of the inverter-rectifier interaction identified.},

year={2017},

abstract={Solid-state transformers (SSTs) could serve as interfaces between a medium-voltage (MV) AC grid and a low-voltage (LV) DC load or source, i. e., could be employed in applications with power supply character such as traction auxiliary supplies or rack-level power supplies in future datacenters. For handling the high input-side AC voltage and output side current, SSTs are typically realized as input-series output-parallel (ISOP) arrangements of multiple converter cells, whereby each cell comprises a medium-frequency isolation stage. This paper presents such a multi-cell 25 kW all-SiC MVAC-LVDC SST (6.6 kV AC to 400 V DC) based on the isolated front end (IFE) approach, which is an interesting alternative to the isolated back end (IBE) configuration mainly discussed in literature so far. The IFE concept is briefly explained, the main component stresses are derived, and a converter cell prototype is designed and tested. The 5 kW prototype cell features a power density of 1.5 kW/l (24.6 W/in3) and a measured peak efficiency of 97.5%. This is significantly higher than previously published data for IFE-based SSTs, and in the same range as what has been reported recently for industrial IBE-based SSTs. Thus, this paper confirms that the IFE approach can be a feasible and interesting alternative for realizing MVAC-LVDC SST systems with low complexity.},

abstract={Due to much higher achievable blocking voltage and faster switching speed, power devices based on wide bandgap (WBG) silicon carbide (SiC) material are ideal for medium voltage (MV) power electronics applications. For example, a 15 kV SiC MOSFET allows a simple and efficient two-level converter configuration for a 7.2 kV solid state transformer (SST) for smart grid applications. Compared with multilevel input series and output parallel (ISOP) solution, this approach offers higher efficiency and reliability, reduced system weight and cost by operating at medium to high switching frequency. However, the main concern is how to precisely implement this device in different MV applications, achieving highest switching frequency while maintaining good thermal performance. This paper reviews the characteristics of 15 kV SiC MOSFET and offers a comprehensive guideline of implementing this device in practical MV power conversion scenarios such as AC-DC, DC-DC and AC-AC in terms of topology selection, loss optimization and thermal management.},

	abstract={This paper addresses the stability issues and some control solutions in solid-state transformers (SST). An SST is built using three cascaded stages, including an ac-dc rectifier, a dual active bridge (DAB) converter, and a dc-ac inverter. Multistage cascaded converters are highly prone to instabilities due to the interaction between stages. Hence, the control system must be designed in a way that solves this detrimental interaction effect. Additionally, the stability issue can become even more complicated when a distributed energy storage device (DESD) and a distributed renewable energy resource (DRER) are added to the SST. In this paper, the stability of the SST is studied by applying the Middlebrook's criterion. To do so, the converters' small-signal models will be derived, and the frequency domain analyses is carried out to predict the time domain behavior of the SST. An average model of SST will be simulated in PSCAD to validate the stability analyses predictions.},

	pages={1-8}, 
	abstract={Thanks to their comparatively low system complexity, SSTs based on an isolated front end (IFE) approach are suitable for space and weight-constrained medium voltage (MV) AC to low voltage (LV) DC power supply applications, e.g., in future traction, naval, subsea or aerospace systems. The IFE approach connects series resonant isolation stages operating in the half-cycle discontinuous-conduction-mode (HC-DCM) directly to the MV AC grid in an input-series, output-parallel (ISOP) configuration, but the entire control, i.e., the shaping of the grid current for unity power factor and output voltage regulation, is carried out by a second, non-isolated conversion stage on the LV side. However, since the isolation stages do not operate with a DC but with an AC or |AC| input voltage, the transformer magnetizing current available for ZVS as well as the voltage to be switched vary over the grid period. Taking into account also component tolerances among the cascaded converter cells, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the ZVS behavior under these conditions, and of the associated losses and EMI considerations, presenting a loss-optimal choice of the magnetizing inductance value and of the dead time (interlock time) of the isolation stages' bridge legs. A time-dependent variation of the latter to achieve ZVS over the entire grid period without an increase of the isolation stage losses is proposed. The considerations are verified at the example of the Swiss SST (S3T), an all-SiC 25 kW, 6.6 kV MVAC to 400 V LVDC converter system, using a detailed simulation model, including non-linear MOSFET capacitances.},

In normal load scenario, this converter operates in an open loop resonant mode with a fixed switching frequency equals to the resonant frequency of the series resonant tank. Thus, zero voltage turn on at primary side and zero current turn off at secondary side are secured from zero to full load. When overload happens, the resonant capacitors will be clamped to the output voltage by the additional paralleled diodes. The proposed converter automatically switches to resonant and DAB mixed operation mode; therefore, the resonant current is naturedly limited. With zero to full load range soft switching and fast overload protection, the proposed topology is especially suitable for MV medium frequency applications utilizing high-voltage SiC MOSFETs. The converter operation modes are analyzed using time-domain waveforms and graphical state trajectory to derive the quantitative relationship between duty cycle, output voltage, and the overload current. Based on these relationships, a predictive duty cycle control is proposed to further limit the overload current of the resonant tank by sensing the output voltage. Combing the proposed topology and the predictive control, cycle-by-cycle overload and short-circuit protections are achieved. To fully utilize the capability of the 15-kV SiC MOSFET, magnetizing inductance, dead time, MV transformer, and resonant components are optimized with the operating range of 6-12 kV and 20-100 kHz. An experimental prototype running at 6 kV and 40 kHz is successfully tested with peak efficiency exceeding 98%. Test waveforms at no load and 10-kW full load validate the zero to full load range soft switching capability. Short circuit protection test demonstrates a 25-us overload protection speed.},

	abstract={Thanks to their comparatively low system complexity, SSTs based on an isolated front end (IFE) approach are suitable for space and weight-constrained medium voltage (MV) AC to low voltage (LV) DC power supply applications, e.g., in future traction, naval, subsea or aerospace systems. The IFE approach connects series resonant isolation stages operating in the half-cycle discontinuous-conduction-mode (HC-DCM) directly to the MV AC grid in an input-series, output-parallel (ISOP) configuration, but the entire control, i.e., the shaping of the grid current for unity power factor and output voltage regulation, is carried out by a second, non-isolated conversion stage on the LV side. However, since the isolation stages do not operate with a DC but with an AC or |AC| input voltage, the transformer magnetizing current available for ZVS as well as the voltage to be switched vary over the grid period. Taking into account also component tolerances among the cascaded converter cells, this paper provides an in-depth analysis of the ZVS behavior under these conditions, and of the associated losses and EMI considerations, presenting a loss-optimal choice of the magnetizing inductance value and of the dead time (interlock time) of the isolation stages' bridge legs. A time-dependent variation of the latter to achieve ZVS over the entire grid period without an increase of the isolation stage losses is proposed. The considerations are verified at the example of the Swiss SST (S3T), an all-SiC 25 kW, 6.6 kV MVAC to 400 V LVDC converter system, using a detailed simulation model, including non-linear MOSFET capacitances.},

	abstract={The massive integration of distributed generation in the grid poses new challenges to the system operators, like the reverse power flow from the Low Voltage (LV) to Medium Voltage (MV) grid. In the case of high DG power production and low load absorption, the voltage rises in the line reaching the upper voltage limit. At this regard the Smart Transformer (ST) offers a new possibility to limit the reverse power flow in the MV grids. The ST can adapt the voltage waveform modifying the frequency in order to interact with the local distributed generation, that are normally equipped with droop characteristic. However when a fast change in the frequency is applied to avoid reverse power flow to MV grid, stability problems, so far not investigated, arise. In this paper the stability analysis has been performed analytically and validated by means of Control- Hardware-In-Loop (CHIL) in a Real Time Digital Simulator (RTDS) and with experimental results in lab.},

	abstract={Renewable energy penetration in the low-voltage grid faces several limitations due to the current grid topology. Master/slave micro-grids could help solving these issues, by offering additional services to the grid such as the power management of the distributed power energy sources. In some cases, the power produced by the distributed energy sources exceeds the local consumption of the low-voltage grid. The consequent reverse power flow can be either dangerous (for the medium voltage) or impossible (for a micro-grid with limited storage). The droop characteristic of commercial inverter can be exploited to avoid this behaviour. However, stability problems can arise due to a low phase-locked-loop (PLL) bandwidth. This study investigates the stability of this solution depending on the bandwidth of the PLL of the distributed power generation sources.},

	abstract={Solid-state transformers (SSTs) are power electronic interfaces between medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) systems that provide galvanic isolation by means of medium frequency (MF) transformers, making them suitable for MVAC to LVDC conversion in environments where weight and volume constraints apply. This paper discusses an isolated front end (IFE) SST concept that allows to reduce the complexity and physical size of the MV side converter assemblies compared to the well-known isolated back end (IBE) SST topologies. The IFE approach performs the entire grid current and output voltage control on the LV side using standard non-isolated |AC|-DC boost converter stages. A generic comparison of the IFE and the IBE concepts reveals that the lower complexity of the IFE, e. g., a lower total MV blocking voltage requirement (number of cascaded cells), comes along with higher device RMS currents and hence slightly higher chip area requirements. On the other hand, a case study considering a 25kW, 6.6 kV AC to 400V DC SST shows advantages of the IFE in part-load operation due to lower switching and transformer core losses. This makes the IFE approach interesting for applications where MF isolation instead of low frequency isolation is required because of space and weight constraints (e. g., traction, subsea or aircraft environments), and where low system complexity is desirable.},

	abstract={Medium-voltage dc/dc converters have recently acquired importance in the smart grid and dc distribution framework. However, several open issues remain with regard to the reliability of such systems. This paper proposes a modular isolated dc/dc converter with multiple quadruple active bridge building blocks. This design, in combination with a virtual resistor-based control, weights the paths depending on the components wear-out and can balance the stress of the semiconductors in the attempt of extending overall system lifetime. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated in simulations and supported with measurements on a small-scale demonstrator with open modules, built in order to verify in real time the capability of controlling the thermal stress of the semiconductors.},

Compared to the traditional cascade H-bridge converter, it has much enhanced system reliability owing to no shoot-through problems and lower switching loss with the help of using power MOSFETs. In addition, a unified control scheme is proposed for active-reactive power control and individual voltage balancing control, which is modular and easy to implement. In the end, a laboratory three-unit cascade active-front-end converter based on the half-bridge dual-boost/buck converter is constructed and tested. The experimental results verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed active-front-end converter and the unified control scheme for IUT.},

	abstract={The concept of realizing a small size “solid-state” transformer has been discussed for some time. A fairly straightforward approach to accomplish size reduction in a transformer feeding a conventional rectifier-inverter system is to introduce an isolated DC-DC converter in the DC link, isolation being provided by a high frequency transformer. So also, several topologies that employ AC-AC converters connected on primary and secondary sides of a high frequency transformer to reduce the size and weight of the magnetic core have been reported in literature. Such AC-AC converters need switches with bi-directional voltage blocking and current carrying capability, which are commonly realized with pairs of gate turn-off devices such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT). This paper explores the possibilities of employing AC-AC switched mode power converters in combination with reactive elements to realize a chopped AC link, thereby decreasing the required magnetic core size for voltage transformation and isolation. A primary advantage of this approach is that, the static power converter needs only six devices to implement a three-phase electronic transformer, which makes it an economical solution. Operating principles, magnetic design and other practical issues are discussed. Detailed computer simulations accompanied with experimental verification are presented in the paper},

	abstract={Increasing decentralized energy production challenges the distribution grid [1], [2], and, in many countries, power generation and consumption are spatially separated, meaning that energy must be transferred over a long distance [3]. This calls for novel ways to transfer power to the loads without overloading grid feeders and to connect new intelligent loads and storage [4], which typically form the actual electric grid hybrid (ac and dc) and couple with other energy networks (multimodal) [5]. In the current configuration, transformers are passive devices that do not enable dc systems to connect or interface the electric grid with other energy grids.},

This paper presents a comparison of a 1000 kVA three-phase, low-frequency distribution transformer (LFT) and an equally rated SST, with respect to volume, weight, losses, and material costs, where the corresponding data of the SST is partly based on a full-scale prototype design. It is found that the SST's costs are at least five times and its losses about three times higher, its weight similar but its volume reduced to less than 80%. In addition, an AC/DC application is also considered, where the comparison turns out in favor of the SST-based concept, since its losses are only about half compared to the LFT-based system, and the volume and the weight are reduced to about one third, whereas the material costs advantage of the LFT is much less pronounced.},

The advantages of both multilevel converters and the parallel converters are available in this family of converters. The specialty of this converter is that, multilevel voltage can be generated by using only one DC voltage level. Capacitor voltage balancing is not necessary in this type of multilevel converter. The interleaving switching method generates circulating current within the converter modules. The magnitude of the circulating current depends on the switching frequency, module inductance, dc link voltage and the numbers of parallel modules. It is also observed that, the circulating current of a parallel interleaved converter is constant for a switching frequency, module inductance and the dc link voltage. This means the converter has better efficiency with high output current. This converter can be very suitable for low voltage and high current applications.},

In fact, most money is spent on power conditioning and cooling systems. Therefore, the efficiency of data center and power quality are important topics and can be addressed by careful design. There is a need for research into application of innovative design and state-of-the-art technology for optimizing power supply in data centers. The paper investigates potential of a state-of-the-art technology such as solid state transformer (SST). The simulation proves that SST has potential to improve operational efficiency.

	abstract={This paper proposes a power converter architecture for the implementation of an ultrafast charging station for electric vehicles (EVs). The versatile converter topology is based on the concept of the power electronic transformer. For the direct transformerless coupling to the medium-voltage grid, a cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter is utilized. On the level of each submodule, integrated split battery energy storage elements play the role of power buffers, reducing thus the influence of the charging station on the distribution grid. The power interface between the stationary split storage stage and the EV batteries is performed through the use of parallel-connected dual-half-bridge dc/dc converters, shifting the isolation requirements to the medium-frequency range. By choosing several different submodule configurations for the parallel connection, a multiport output concept is achieved, implying the ability to charge several EVs simultaneously without the use of additional high-power chargers. All possible charging station operating modes among with the designed necessary control functions are analyzed. The state-of-charge self-balancing mode of the delta-connected CHB converter is also introduced. Finally, the development of a downscaled laboratory prototype is described, and preliminary experimental results are provided.},

	abstract={Integration of charging stations for electric vehicles (EVs) will result in severe stress on electric grid. The EVs connected to the grid can also act as a source of energy and this demands greater control as well as coordination for better utilization. Conventional power transformers (CPTs) utilized in the EV charging stations are not well equipped for meeting these challenges. Recently, smart transformer (ST) has been proposed as an alternative to CPT. The ST connects medium voltage (MV) grid to low voltage (LV) grid with two intermediate MV and LV dc links. This paper utilizes the availability of the dc links of the ST to integrate the EVs charging station to electric grid rather than connecting these through the CPTs to the grid. A comprehensive analysis of sizing of the power converters utilized in the considered system has been presented. A comparison of efficiency for the different configurations is carried out and the possible more efficient scenario is suggested. Infact, the ST based EV charging system is found to be more efficient in comparison to CPT based EV charging station. The performance of ST based EV charging station is verified through simulation studies.},

Solid state transformer (SST) is a kind of power electronics equipment which utilises power electronics technology to achieve voltage conversion. This paper adopts a topology of single-phase smart modular cascaded SST which consists of three stages, cascaded modular rectifier stage, the dual active bridge (DAB) converter stage, and the single-phase full-bridge inverter stage. The output-paralleled DAB converters offer a DC-bus port. This study proposes an improving MPPT method for the PV cells which directly connect to the DC-bus port. Rectifier stage adopts a single-phase d–q vector-based common-duty-radio controller aiming at balancing each modular current, DAB stage utilizes a voltage feedforward and feedback-based controller to regulate each modular voltage. The DC-bus voltage could be regulated to track MPP of PV cells. Compared to conventional control strategy, the improving one simplifies the circuit structure, reduces the controlled variables, provides the possibility of increasing the number of cascaded modules, and makes it easier to access to distribution network. Simulation results are presented to proving the proposed control strategy. In addition, a 6kW experimental prototype is built to validate the effectiveness.},

A 15 kW, 500 kHz DC/DC converter is demonstrated as the most important stage of the system overall, which can be scalable to a 225 kW 4160 VAC to 400 VDC system. Motivation of a CLLC resonant converter and its design parameters determination is carefully illustrated. The high-frequency transformer is the key element for the DC/DC converter. Then, the paper focuses on high-frequency transformer design to realize high-voltage insulation, high efficiency, and high density at the same time. Based on a split winding UU core transformer structure, transformer insulation materials and dimension parameters are determined referring to the IEEE insulation standard. The transformer magnetic loss model is reviewed based on which loss design tradeoff is carefully analyzed. Different working frequency impact on transformer design over three different core materials is also presented. Finally, a 500 kHz transformer prototype has been developed and demonstrated with the IEEE standard required insulation tests. A whole CLLC resonant converter is also present with experiments results. The converter holds outstanding 98% efficiency and 2.9 kW/L power density.},

The high-frequency transformer is an essential element for the S4T, and it has a unique feature of dc-biased flux. Design of such a high-frequency transformer is also discussed in detail in this paper. Soft startup, shutdown, and fast dynamic response under load transients are also attractive behaviors because of the low inertia of the S4T. Experimental results from a 208-V/10-kV·A S4T unit are presented.},

	abstract={The back-to-back connection of two three-tosingle- phase matrix converters (MCs) through a highfrequency transformer to create the so called MC-based solid state transformer (SST) for interactive grid interfacing is proposed in this paper. The solution provides single-stage bidirectional ac-ac power conversion. There are advantages of no lifetime-limited storage capacitors, light weight, and compact volume. The conventional modulation methods of this MC-SST system require additional control design for power management. Besides, space vector modulation contains sophisticated voltage and current vectors computation and duty cycle composition, considering the two back-to-back connected three-to-single-phase MCs. In this paper, a model predictive control (MPC) is proposed for this MC-SST linking different ac grids. The proposed MPC predicts the state variables based on the discrete model of MC-SST system and the present circuit variables, then selects an optimal switching state that ensures the smallest value of a cost function, for the next sampling time. Simulation and experimental studies are carried out to demonstrate effectiveness and simplicity of the proposed MPC for such MC-SST grid-interfacing system.},

Equivalent resonant frequency of the proposed CS-SRC is analyzed in both time domain and frequency domain. Resonant frequency calculation equation is derived and can be used to accurately design the resonant tank. Zero voltage switching (ZVS) for 15 kV SiC MOSFET in CS-SRC topology under extremely wide input voltage from 0V to 10 kV is analyzed and designed at a medium frequency (MF) of 40 kHz. Partial discharge for the 15 kV SiC MOSFET's parasitic capacitor are explained and the associated turn on loss equations are derived. Magnetizing inductance Lm and deadtime tdead are further optimized based on the trade-off between the turn on loss and conduction loss of the semiconductor devices. A fully functional and compact SST based on the proposed concept is developed and tested with an input of voltage of 7.2 kVac and from 1 kW to 12 kW. The efficiency is higher than 97% under most load conditions.},

Interleaving reduces the currents stresses through the legs of the modular multilevel converter, which is responsible for the voltage modulation across the submodules. The medium-frequency transformer provides galvanic isolation and operates at 10 kHz, allowing weight and volume reduction, while connecting the interleaved modular multilevel converter at the high voltage side to a full-bridge converter at the low voltage side. This topology operates as a dual-active bridge converter where the phase-shift angle controls the bidirectional power flow. The topology is suitable for a wide range of medium-voltage applications such as AC or DC distributed power systems, traction and renewable energy systems. The converter features, modulation technique and control scheme are presented. The topology validation is made through simulation considering a three-phase converter rated at 13.8 kV/60 Hz, four submodules whose switching frequency is 10 kHz, 11.27-kV/800-V, 10-kHz medium frequency transformer, output voltage of 800 Vdc and rated power of 100 kW.},

The concept offers the possibility of bilateral power flow as well as three-level pulse width modulation on the ac side. It is shown that by alternately commutating the VSC and the cycloconverter it is possible to achieve either zero-voltage or zero-current switching conditions for all of the semiconductor elements. At low load the ac load current becomes insufficient for recharging the snubber capacitors of the VSC and the commutations may therefore become too slow. However, a quasi-resonant commutation mode for the voltage source converter is proposed that allows for sufficiently fast commutations down to zero load.},

The proposed configuration is suitable for high-input-voltage applications. In order to ensure the proper operation of ISOP inverter system, equal sharing of input voltage and sharing of output current among the constituent inverters must be ensured. The relationship between input voltage sharing (IVS) and output current sharing (OCS) is analyzed in this paper. In order to realize equilibrium among the constituent inverters, a three-loop control strategy, consisting of a common output voltage loop, IVS loops, and individual inner current loops, is proposed. The common output voltage loop regulates the inverter system at desired output voltage and provides the basic reference for inner current loops, which is adjusted by the IVS loops to achieve IVS. Both the output current and the output filter inductor current of the individual inverter can be chosen as the feedback signal for the inner current loop and the difference is compared. A 2-kVA two-module ISOP inverter system prototype is fabricated and tested in the laboratory and the experimental results verify the proposed control strategy.},

	abstract={In this paper, an interleaved active-power-filter concept with reduced size of passive components is discussed. The topology is composed of two pulsewidth-modulation interleaved voltage-source inverters connected together on the ac line and sharing the same dc-link capacitor. The advantages of the proposed approach are as follows: 1. significant reduction in the linkage inductors' size by decreasing the line-current ripple due to the interleaving; 2. reduction of the switching stress in the dc-link capacitor, due to the shared connection; and 3. more accurate compensation for high-power applications, because the power sharing allows one to use a higher switching frequency in each inverter. This paper analyzes the design of the passive components and gives a practical and low-cost solution for the minimization of the circulation currents between the inverters, by using common-mode coils. Several simulation results are discussed, and experimental results with a three-phase 10-kVA 400-V unit are obtained to validate the theoretical analysis.},

	abstract={This paper explores a new configuration for modular DC/DC converters, namely, series connection at the input, and parallel connection at the output, such that the converters share the input voltage and load current equally. This is an important step toward realizing a truly modular power system architecture, where low-power, low-voltage, building block modules can be connected in any series/parallel combination at input or at output, to realize any given system specifications. A three-loop control scheme, consisting of a common output voltage loop, individual inner current loops, and individual input voltage loops, is proposed to achieve input voltage and load current sharing. The output voltage loop provides the basic reference for inner current loops, which is modified by the respective input voltage loops. The average of converter input voltages, which is dynamically varying, is chosen as the reference for input voltage loops. This choice of reference eliminates interaction among different control loops. The input-series and output-parallel (ISOP) configuration is analyzed using the incremental negative resistance model of DC/DC converters. Based on the analysis, design methods for input voltage controller are developed. Analysis and proposed design methods are verified through simulation, and experimentally, on an ISOP system consisting of two forward converters.},

	abstract={Medium voltage high-power applications are usually realized using high voltage semiconductors (3.3 kV and above) operated in the hard switching mode with low switching frequencies (several hundreds of hertz). However, for high-power dc-dc converters employing a transformer for galvanic isolation, it is attractive to increase the switching frequency so that the transformer size can be reduced. An increase of the switching frequency implies an increase of the switching losses, and this has to be mitigated somehow, usually by choice of resonant topologies or soft switching techniques. Main focus of the paper is on the operation of the insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) within a high-power dc-dc LLC resonant converter, in order to explore interactions between semiconductor and circuit properties, which both must be simultaneously considered in order to achieve the best utilization of a high voltage power semiconductor operating at higher switching frequencies. For these purposes, switching properties of a standard 6.5 kV IGBT are compared with switching properties of two different optimized versions of a 6.5 kV IGBT. Experimental results are included to support theoretical considerations and findings.},

Fault handling or redundancy design can be achieved to further improve the reliability when some DC-DC modules break down. In addition, input voltage sharing (IVS) control can be omitted to simplify the control system and improve the stability.

	number={}, 
	pages={1-8}, 
	abstract={Double circuit lines are common for transmitting the electrical power in high voltage (HV) and/or medium voltage (MV) power system. During the faults in one of the lines or transformers of the double circuit lines, one line is disconnected from the system and the healthy line is utilized for supplying the entire load. In that case, the transformer supplying the entire load could be overloaded. For the safe operation of the transformer, it is needed to disconnect some of the loads. This partial disconnection of MV/HV power system can severally effect the performance of critical loads. Recently, power electronic based transformer equipped with effective control and communication called smart transformer (ST) has been proposed for installation in the distribution system in place of conventional transformer. One of the most important feature of ST is to allow for connection of ac and dc grid forming hybrid grid which allow easy integration of renewable energy sources and storage. Considering these feature of ST, this paper proposes a new functionality of the ST where it provides continuous power to a section of the loads during the partial disconnection of MV/HV power system and improves the performance of power system. This new feature of ST has been proved through power system computer aided design (PSCAD) software based simulation results. Power hardware in loop (PHIL) and control hardware in loop (CHIL) is under development to test the idea.},

abstract={The electronic transformer is a device which behaves in the same manner as a conventional power transformer in that it steps voltage levels up or down while providing isolation and can accommodate load current of any power factor. It contains thyristor power switches which convert the low-frequency (dc to 400-Hz) voltage wave to a high-frequency (in the order of 10 000 Hz) wave. A comparatively small magnetic transformer then provides the voltage level transformation and isolation functions. Similar thyristor power switches then reconstruct the original low-frequency wave at the desired output voltage level.

abstract={With the new generation of full low floor passenger trains, the constraints of weight and size on the traction transformer are becoming stronger. The ultimate target weight for the transformer is 1 kg/kVA. The reliability and the efficiency are also becoming more important. To address these issues, a multilevel topology using medium frequency transformers has been developed. It permits to reduce the weight and the size of the system and improves the global life cycle cost of the vehicle. The proposed multilevel converter consists of sixteen bidirectional direct current converters (cycloconverters) connected in series to the catenary 15 kV, 16.7 Hz through a choke inductor. The cycloconverters are connected to sixteen medium frequency transformers (400 Hz) that are fed by sixteen four-quadrant converters connected in parallel to a 1.8 kV DC link with a 2f filter. The control, the command and the hardware of the prototype are described in detail.},

abstract={The analysis and design of an LCC-type power resonant inverter for transportation application in a train system is presented in this paper. The inverter powers the linear induction motor (LIM) used in urban transit applications. It has low components stresses compared with the conventional series and series-parallel resonant topologies. The voltage regulation is achieved by using a self-oscillating controller that results in high power efficiency for wide range of current motor operation. Moreover, by using an optimized transformer leakage inductance value, Zero-Current Zero-Voltage (ZCZVS) operation is achieved for the primary-side IGBTs, which allows for high switching frequency operation with lower power losses, resulting in increased power density. The ZCZVS operation is achieved without using an auxiliary circuit by utilizing the switches capacitances and the transformer leakage inductance.

abstract={Although it has long been argued that electronic power converters can help improve system controllability, reliability, size, and efficiency, their penetration in power systems is still quite low. The often-cited barriers of higher cost and lower reliability of the power converters are quite high if power electronics is used as direct, one-to-one, replacement for the existing electromechanical equipment. However, if the whole power distribution system were designed as a system of controllable converters, the overall system cost and reliability could actually improve, as is currently the case at low power levels within computer and telecom equipment. Starting from the example of a computer power system, the paper contemplates possible future ac and dc electronic power distribution system architectures, especially in the presence of renewable energy sources. The proposed nanogrid-microgrid-...-grid structure achieves hierarchical dynamic decoupling of generation, distribution, and consumption by using bidirectional converters as energy control centers. This is illustrated by the description and simulation of static and dynamic operation of a dc nanogrid in a hypothetical future sustainable home. Several ideas for modeling, analysis, and system-level design of such systems, including power flow control, protection, stability, and subsystem interactions, are presented.},

abstract={In this tutorial we describe a list of analytical methods from optimization, control theory, and machine learning that can be used for infusing autonomy in large-scale interconnected networks of microgrids with as little human intervention in their control loops as possible. The cornerstone medium for promoting this autonomy is smart transformers made out of solid-state technology, which serve the dual role of a power-electronic transformer with very fast switching capability, and, hence, with significantly smaller size than conventional magnetic transformers, as well as of a powerful computer or logic-machine that can make intelligent decisions via communication. Solid-state transformers (SSTs) are, in fact, being anticipated to be the backbone of tomorrow's modern distribution grid. Microgrids typically have three layers of controllers - namely, primary control (for switching and circuit-breaking decisions), secondary control (for voltage and frequency regulation, and synchronization), and tertiary control (where a centralized supervisory controller communicates with energy management centers for updating setpoints according to load demands, and other changes in the circuit). Operating these control layers in today's microgrids require professional knowledge of the system, and calls for the operators to manually configure each of the components. With technology advancing to low-cost microprocessor driven devices such as SSTs, we propose a suite of new control and learning approaches that exploit different `Internet of things' functionalities embedded inside the SSTs, and thereby guarantee at-scale resilience, reliability, fault-tolerance, and autonomy for tomorrow's distribution networks.},

abstract={Silicon (Si) insulated-gate bipolar transistors are widely used in railway traction converters. In the near future, silicon carbide (SiC) technology will push the limits of switching devices in three directions: higher blocking voltage, higher operating temperature, and higher switching speeds. The first silicon carbide (SiC) MOSFET modules are available on the market and look promising. Although they are still limited in breakdown voltage, these wide-bandgap components should improve traction-chain efficiency. Particularly, a significant reduction in the switching losses is expected which should lead to improvements in power-weight ratios. Nevertheless, because of the high switching speed and the high current levels required by traction applications, the implementation of these new modules is critical. An original method is proposed to compare, in terms of stray inductance, several dc bus-bar designs. To evaluate the potential of these new devices, a first set of measurements, based on a single-pulse test-bench, was obtained. The switching behavior of SiC devices was well understood at turn-off and turn-on. To complete this work, the authors use an opposition method to compare Si-IGBT and SiC-MOSFET modules in voltage source inverter operation. For this purpose, a second test-bench, allowing electrical and thermal measurements, was developed. Experimental results confirm the theoretical loss-calculation of the single-pulse tests and the correct operation of up to three modules directly connected in parallel. This analysis provides guidelines for a full SiC inverter design, and prospects for developments in traction applications are presented.},

abstract={Power and energy measurements in smart grids require a measurement system capable of performing signal processing at the higher harmonic frequencies that are present in power grids. For the calibration process of instrument voltage transformers, or high-voltage dividers, it is necessary to have a high-voltage source with an appropriate frequency range. The fundamental element of such a source is the output high-voltage transformer operating at a nominal voltage of 10 kV and in the frequency range from 200 Hz up to 10 kHz. The output current is assumed to be lower than 20 mA. This paper focuses on the design and realization of the magnetic circuit of the transformer described above. Trafoperm, ferrite or nanocrystalline materials can be used for the frequency range considered here. Ferrite materials usually reach saturation at a magnetic flux density of 0.2 T with very low permeability values, while trafoperm material usually suffers from unacceptable power losses in higher frequency areas. This is the main reason why these materials are not suitable for use in a wide range of frequencies, and some combined magnetic cores must be used. The proposed solution is based on magnetic cut C type cores made from nanocrystalline alloy (VITROPERM 500), which behaves better in the frequency range under consideration. The magnetic parameters of this material were measured and compared with trafoperm, and then, the 10 kV high-voltage transformer was designed and manufactured.},

abstract={Within a solid-state transformer, the isolated dc-dc converter and in particular its medium-frequency transformer are one of the critical components, as it provides the required isolation between primary and secondary sides and the voltage conversion typically necessary for the operation of the system.

This paper presents an optimization routine and its underlying loss and thermal models, which are used to design a 166 kW/20 kHz transformer prototype achieving 99.4% efficiency at a power density of 44 kW/dm<sup>3</sup>.

abstract={DC microgrids (MGs) have been gaining a continually increasing interest over the past couple of years both in academia and industry. The advantages of dc distribution when compared to its ac counterpart are well known. The most important ones include higher reliability and efficiency, simpler control and natural interface with renewable energy sources, and electronic loads and energy storage systems. With rapid emergence of these components in modern power systems, the importance of dc in today's society is gradually being brought to a whole new level. A broad class of traditional dc distribution applications, such as traction, telecom, vehicular, and distributed power systems can be classified under dc MG framework and ongoing development, and expansion of the field is largely influenced by concepts used over there. This paper aims first to shed light on the practical design aspects of dc MG technology concerning typical power hardware topologies and their suitability for different emerging smart grid applications. Then, an overview of the state of the art in dc MG protection and grounding is provided. Owing to the fact that there is no zero-current crossing, an arc that appears upon breaking dc current cannot be extinguished naturally, making the protection of dc MGs a challenging problem. In relation with this, a comprehensive overview of protection schemes, which discusses both design of practical protective devices and their integration into overall protection systems, is provided. Closely coupled with protection, conflicting grounding objectives, e.g., minimization of stray current and common-mode voltage, are explained and several practical solutions are presented. Also, standardization efforts for dc systems are addressed. Finally, concluding remarks and important future research directions are pointed out.},

abstract={This paper proposes a generalized formulation for selective harmonic elimination pulse-width modulation (SHE-PWM) control suitable for high-voltage high-power cascaded multilevel voltage source converters (VSC) with both equal and nonequal dc sources used in constant frequency utility applications. This formulation offers more degrees of freedom for specifying the cost function without any physical changes to the converter circuit, as compared to conventional stepped waveform technique, and hence the performance of the converter is greatly enhanced. The paper utilizes the merits of the hybrid real coded genetic algorithm (HRCGA) in finding the optimal solution to the nonlinear equation system with fast and guaranteed convergence. It is confirmed that multiple independent sets of solutions exist. Different operating points for both five- and seven-level converters including single- and three-phase patterns are documented. Selected experimental results are reported to verify and validate the theoretical and simulation findings.},

abstract={A bidirectional high-frequency isolated ac-dc converter for utility direct interfaced electric vehicle charger with vehicle-to-grid (V2G) capability is presented in this paper. This type of charger can achieve the direct utility interface with medium voltage input. It is composed of multilevel cascaded H-bridge ac-dc converter as the first stage and modular current-fed dual active bridge dc-dc converters as the second stage. For the cascaded H-bridge converter, a unified control to balance the cascaded H-bridge dc voltages is proposed for both charging and discharging modes. For the second dc-dc isolation stage, the current-fed dual active bridge converter is used in facing of the wide conversion gain in battery charging application and also to reduce the charging current ripple. Meanwhile, to improve the system flexibility and reliability, decentralized control is utilized for individual current-fed dual active bridge converters in view of the battery charging profile. The proposed method along with the presented topology can achieve voltage balance in spite of the power flow direction, simplification of the controller for the dc-dc modules and can also bear unbalanced power flow.

abstract={Cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter technology is actually the most popular solution for grid-connected converters in both medium- and high-voltage applications. This paper introduces a new control of a single-phase CHB active rectifier. The control uses a direct grid current control based on adaptive resonant controllers. The resonant controllers are adapting to slow fluctuation of ac grid frequency. The challenging problem of CHB converters is dc-link capacitor voltage balancing especially under unbalanced load conditions. This paper presents a reliable voltage-balancing technique utilizing energy estimation of particular dc-link capacitor banks and simple prediction of the changes of their energies. A nonlinear behavior of the converter caused by power semiconductors voltage drops and dead-time effects is minimized by auxiliary adaptive resonant controllers. The resulting control has very good performance, including the operation under unbalanced load conditions, and achieves low total harmonic distortion of converter grid current. The theoretical results were verified by experiments made on the developed CHB active rectifier prototype with three power cells in cascade.},

abstract={The integration of large-scale PV systems to the grid is a growing trend in modern power systems. The cascaded H-bridge (CHB) converter is a suitable candidate for the grid interconnection due to its modular characteristics, high-quality output waveforms and capability of connecting to medium-voltage grids. However, the CHB converter requires isolated DC sources. In order to avoid the leakage currents caused by the high potential differences across the parasitic capacitance of the PV panels to ground, an isolated DC-DC conversion stage is required when the CHB topology is used. The objective of this paper is to compare two PV system configurations based on the CHB multilevel converter using two isolated DC-DC converter topologies, namely the boost-half-bridge (BHB) and the flyback, for their performance on providing isolation and achieving individual MPPT at the DC-DC power conversion stage of large-scale PV power systems.

The 3-stage configuration, with a high frequency transformer and 2 DC links, allows the electrical separation of the LV and MV grids. This leads to the independence of the two grids: any disturbance downstream and upstream can be compensated and mitigated by the ST action, which is the case of the unbalanced load condition of the LV grids. The unbalanced currents demanded by the loads could create unbalanced voltages at the LV side and also unbalanced currents at the MV side of a traditional transformer. This paper presents the improvements achieved by ST implementation in terms of voltage and current balancing: with a proper control of the ST, it provides balanced voltage in the LV grid, demanding a balanced current from the MV grid. This feature increases the power quality in both grids and provides an improved service to the customers.},

This paper carries out an overview about microgrid structures and control techniques at different hierarchical levels. At the power converter level, a detailed analysis of the main operation modes and control structures for power converters belonging to microgrids is carried out, focusing mainly on grid-forming, grid-feeding, and grid-supporting configurations. This analysis is extended as well toward the hierarchical control scheme of microgrids, which, based on the primary, secondary, and tertiary control layer division, is devoted to minimize the operation cost, coordinating support services, meanwhile maximizing the reliability and the controllability of microgrids. Finally, the main grid services that microgrids can offer to the main network, as well as the future trends in the development of their operation and control for the next future, are presented and discussed.},

Each module comprises two H-bridges connected as an AC/DC converter and a DC/DC converter with a medium frequency transformer isolation. By having interleaved connection between phases, Uniflex-PM is able to operate under unbalanced conditions. In a two-port Uniflex-PM there are nine capacitors whose voltages, are needed in feedback loops of the system controller, which includes the voltage control loop and balancer. This means that nine voltage transducers are required. The use of so many transducers can make the system unreliable, thus it is desirable to observe the capacitor voltages instead of measuring them. The sliding mode observer (SMO) via equivalent control approach has been selected to be applied to the Uniflex-PM because of its robustness against a class of uncertainties in system equations. Simulation results from SABER are used to demonstrate the use of this observer technique.},

abstract={The modern power network is starting to face huge challenges due to the contemporary paradigms of electricity distribution such as the capability to manage energy coming from different grids as well as from Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and other Distributed Generation (DG) systems. Advanced power electronic converters can provide the means to control power flow and ensure proper and secure operation. This paper presents design and implementation of a predictive control system for a back-to-back three-phase AC-DC-AC multi-level converter employed in Universal and Flexible Power Management (UNIFLEX-PM) of electrical grids. The proposed strategy has been successfully tested for bidirectional power flow operation with different grid operating conditions such as voltage unbalance, frequency variation and harmonic distortion.},

abstract={Solid-state transformers (SSTs) are power electronic converters that provide isolation between a medium-voltage and a low-voltage (LV) system using medium-frequency transformers. The power electronic stages enable full-range control of the terminal voltages and currents and hence of the active and reactive power flows. Thus, SSTs are envisioned as key components of a smart grid. Various SST concepts have been proposed and analyzed in literature concerning technical aspects. However, several issues could potentially limit the applicability of SSTs in distribution grids. Therefore, this paper discusses four essential challenges in detail. It is found that SSTs are less efficient than low-frequency transformers (LFTs), yet their prospective prices are significantly higher. Furthermore, SSTs are not compatible with the protection schemes employed in today&#x2019;s LV grids, i. e., they are not drop-in replacements for LFTs. The limited voltage control range typically required in distribution grids can be provided by competing solutions, which do not involve power electronics (e. g., LFTs with tap changers), or by hybrid transformers, where the comparably inefficient power electronic stage processes only a fraction of the total power. Finally, potential application scenarios of SSTs (AC-DC, DC-DC, weight/space limited applications) are discussed. All considerations are distilled into an applicability flowchart for SST technology.},

abstract={The Smart Transformer (ST) has been proposed for increasing the hosting capacity of renewable energy sources in the power system with advanced control and communication capability. Its capability to connect-and disconnect itself from the main grid and to provide power from the Low Voltage (LV) grid to the Medium Voltage (MV) grid in the grid forming mode are an opportunity to realize an islanded operation mode. This operation mode requires a suitable controller design, which is forming the MV grid and the LV grid at the same time. This work proposes a modular ST architecture consisting of a three phase Cascaded H-Bridge (CHB) converter connected to Quadruple Active Bridge (QAB) converters. The design of the converter and its magnetic components is examined as well as the controller design for the QAB for the capability to address different operation modes. Grid forming operation on the both AC grid sides and the resulting constraints by means of active power availability are examined as well as opportunities to influence the power consumption of the grids. An experimental setup is presented and selected operation modes are demonstrated.},

abstract={Smart transformer (ST) is a power electronic based transformer equipped with effective control and communication. It is expected to play a significant role in future power distribution system, however, their operational features in the medium voltage (MV) power distribution systems are yet not explored. In this paper, operation and control of ST are presented for improving its performance and operational range in a power distribution system consisting of two radial feeders in a city center. For investigating the performance of ST in above system, one conventional power transformer (CPT) is replaced by the ST whereas other feeder is continued to be supplied through the CPT. In this scheme, the ST is operated such that it makes total MV grid currents of the combined system balanced sinusoidal with unity power factor. Therefore, in addition to providing continuous and reliable operation of ST based loads, the ST can also improve the performance of the loads which are supplied by the CPT in a different feeder. Moreover, the proposed scheme eliminates the need of power quality improvement devices at the other feeder. Therefore, the scheme also makes the application of ST in the distribution system cost effective. Simulation results validate the suitability of ST in improving the performance of multiple feeder medium voltage power distribution system.},

Hence, the inverter is able to inject independently active and reactive power to the grid. The controller provides a proper dynamics decoupled from the grid-impedance magnitude and phase.

Among several scenarios, the smart transformer represents a solution for simultaneously managing low- and medium-voltage grids, providing ancillary services to the distribution grid. However, unlike conventional transformers, the smart transformer has a very limited overload capability, because the junction temperature—which must always be below its maximum limit—is characterized by a short time constant. In this work, an overload control for smart transformer by means of voltage and frequency variations has been proposed and veriﬁed by means of simulations and experiments.},

The high-voltage side is an H-bridge MMC to generate a high-frequency adjustable-magnitude sinusoidal voltage, and the low-voltage side is paralleled multiwindings and rectifiers to allow high-load currents. As the number of MMC voltage levels increases, the complexity of the control system as well as the control algorithm increases largely. In order to simplify the control system and reduce the computation time, a hierarchical control system is designed for the MMC-based PET, and the relevant hierarchical control algorithm is also presented in this paper. The modulation method, capacitor voltage balancing method, and communication solution under the hierarchical control system are all discussed in detail.

	abstract = {The efficient supply of electric power relies strongly on the selection of suitable voltage levels for different sections of the energy distribution system. When higher levels of power are required, a medium-voltage level in the tens of kilovolts range is typically selected. In accordance to current trends in energy conversion, the supply of power must fulfil several functionality requirements among which high power-quality and access to a low-voltage DC interface can be highlighted. Moreover, low energy losses, high power-density, low failure rate and low total cost of ownership remain as major research challenges. Solid-state-transformers (SSTs) comply with these functionality requirements as well as with the demanded high performance levels while directly connecting to medium-voltage. This paper reviews the implementation of SST technology for transportation and Smart-Grid applications. The envisioned architectures for locomotive systems, remotely-operated-vehicles and large scale ships, which benefit from the compactness and high performance of SST are shown. In addition, the possible arrangement of micro-grid systems comprising SST concepts for integration of renewable energy and implementation of DC-microgrids is detailed. The different SST concepts proposed for these applications can be grouped into distinctive categories, leading to a comprehensive classification of, first, general isolated AC-AC conversion systems and later to a specific classification of SST concepts based on the different levels of modularity. Finally, a detailed review of the numerous previously reported and functional SST concepts is presented and a comparison to systems employing low-frequency transformers is given.},
